//! Gate: deleting anything always leaves a way back to the state it was deleted in.
//!
//! An earlier reading of this invariant exempted notes that had been recorded, on the grounds
//! that history already held them. That reading is wrong, and the shape named "a note edited
//! since it was recorded" below is why: being in history says the *path* was written once, not
//! that the state on disk now is the state history holds. Skipping those loses precisely the
//! work that was never saved — the case where losing it hurts most.
//!
//! So the invariant is stated over the state at the moment of deletion, for *every* file, and
//! over a table of shapes rather than a single case.
//!
//! A negative control at the bottom shows the check is falsifiable.
