//! IPC entry points for the commands that change the tree or read the folder's history — run off
//! the main thread.
//!
//! A command that is not `async` runs on the main thread, and there a folder that stops answering
//! (a stalled sync or network drive) freezes the window, as does a render that takes seconds. Each
//! entry here moves its work to a blocking thread and, when it changes the tree, first takes a
//! turn over the places it changes ([`NoteLocks::subtree`]) so no save lands inside them midway.
//!
//! The work itself lives in [`crate::commands`] under the same names, where tests call it
//! directly. Only places a change reads from need a turn: a save never creates a file (one whose
//! note is not there is refused as gone), so a place a change writes to cannot be raced by one.
//!
//! Creating does add to a folder, though, and a folder being deleted has already been kept as it
//! was: something created in it meanwhile would be deleted with it, kept nowhere. So creating takes
//! the folder's own turn ([`creating`]) — it waits while that folder, or one above it, is being
//! changed, and such a change waits for it.
