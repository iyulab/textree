//! Exchanging recorded notes with a remote.
//!
//! Only the app's own references travel: everything under `refs/textree/`. What arrives is kept
//! under [`TRACKING`] first — outside `refs/textree/`, so it is never sent back — and then weighed
//! against what this machine recorded before anything moves:
//!
//! - one side is simply ahead: the other catches up;
//! - the two sides changed **different** notes: they are joined path by path. No note's text is
//!   merged, and both sides' revisions stay in the history, so nothing is lost;
//! - the two sides changed the **same** note differently (or one deleted what the other changed):
//!   nothing moves. The incoming state stays where it arrived until a person decides, and for a
//!   note both sides still hold, the other side's version waits as an alternative of it
//!   ([`crate::alternatives`]). Once every such note is decided — the other version picked, or set
//!   aside — the two sides join, each decided note as it now stands here.
//!
//! Working out what would happen ([`plan`]) is separate from making it happen, and reads only:
//! a join is prepared as an unreferenced revision, which is harmless if never used. Moving a
//! reference has to happen together with writing the notes it changes to disk — a reference that
//! ran ahead of the files would let the next recorded note quietly undo what arrived.
