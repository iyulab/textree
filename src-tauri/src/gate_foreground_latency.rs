//! Gate: what the interface waits on does not grow with how long the vault has been in use.
//!
//! The constraint is on the foreground, and the axis that matters here is not how many notes a
//! folder holds but **how many revisions it has accumulated**. A vault stays the same size
//! while its history grows every time anything is recorded, so a read whose cost tracks the
//! history gets slower for someone who has done nothing but use the application.
//!
//! Measured before it was changed: `measure_reads_against_history_length` is the instrument,
//! kept so the numbers can be taken again rather than remembered. It is ignored by default
//! because it reports rather than asserts, and because timings are not something to fail a
//! build on.
//!
//! What is asserted is **work, not wall clock**: reading one note's history must not visit
//! revisions that never touched it. That is the property the timings were a symptom of, and
//! counting is deterministic where timing is not.
