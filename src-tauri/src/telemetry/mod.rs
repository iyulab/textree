//! Content-free telemetry. Nothing leaves the device unless an official build carries a connection
//! string, and what does leave carries no paths, file names, note titles, folder identifiers,
//! search queries or content:
//!
//! - **Failures** — a panic, a default folder that cannot be made — are `tauri-kit-diagnostics`
//!   reports: built from an allowlist only (the kind of failure, our own source frames, the details
//!   `registry.json` declares — an OS error number), appended to a file in the `reports` folder of
//!   the app's log folder — exactly what would be sent, readable by the person — and sent from there
//!   in the background. What could not go out yet stays for the next launch, so a panic is delivered
//!   even though the process it ended cannot send it.
//! - **`app.launch`** — one usage event per start, which is not a failure and so not a report.
