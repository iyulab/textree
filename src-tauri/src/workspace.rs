//! The notes folders the window knows, named by an id that crosses the IPC instead of a path.
//!
//! A command names the folder it works in by the id [`register`] handed out when the folder was
//! opened, and the command's wrapper turns it back into the path with [`path_of`] before anything
//! else — everything behind the wrapper keeps working on the path, exactly as the tree hands it
//! out, so the per-note turns and the folder's settings are keyed as they always were.
//!
//! An id stays good for the life of the process: an answer that arrives after another folder was
//! opened still names the folder it was asked about.
