//! Where this application keeps its secrets: the OS credential store, through
//! `tauri-kit-credentials`.
//!
//! Secrets live under one fixed entry per kind, so anything that writes or clears an entry writes
//! or clears *the* entry — the one the installed app uses. A unit test that ends by clearing it
//! destroys the user's stored token, and a development build would share credentials with the copy
//! of the app the user actually relies on. Each kind of build therefore gets its own entry:
//!
//! | build | service name |
//! |---|---|
//! | `cargo test` | `<service>.test` |
//! | `cargo build` / `tauri dev` | `<service>.dev` |
//! | shipped release | `<service>` |
//!
//! The kind of build is decided at compile time, by `build_kind!()` written here — in this crate,
//! where `cfg!(test)` describes this application rather than the library.
