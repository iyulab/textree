//! Edits that could not be written to a note already left, kept until they are.
//!
//! While the application runs, such an edit waits in memory and is tried again with every save.
//! Kept only there, it would be lost when the application closes before the note's folder takes it —
//! a folder that stopped answering, or a note that changed on disk and could not be copied beside.
//! So each one is also written here, one file per edit, and removed once it lands; the next time the
//! folder is opened, whatever is still here is tried again.
//!
//! These live with the folder's settings, outside the folder itself. They are not drafts — a draft is
//! something being worked on; these are saves that did not happen — so they have a place of their own.
//! Older releases do not look here, so adding it changes nothing they read.
