//! Writes to one note happen one at a time.
//!
//! Saves run off the main thread, so two of them can be in flight together. For two different
//! notes that is the point — a folder that stops answering for one note must not hold up another.
//! For the same note it would be a loss: a save that stalls after its check and lands late would
//! overwrite a newer one that went ahead meanwhile. A write can't be called back once the disk has
//! it, so the only safe order is the one enforced here: the next save to a note starts after the
//! previous one has actually finished, and checks the note against what that one left.
//!
//! Changes to the tree — renaming, moving, deleting, bringing back — run off the main thread too,
//! and take a turn over everything at or under the paths they change ([`NoteLocks::subtree`]). A
//! save that lands after its note was renamed away would put the old file back under the old name,
//! and one that lands after a delete would bring the note back: so a change to the tree waits for
//! the saves under it to finish, and saves under it wait for the change. Two changes to the tree
//! wait for each other only when one lies inside the other — a folder that stops answering holds
//! up changes to itself, not to the rest of the notes.
