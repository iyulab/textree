/*
 * Backup store — which repository the open folder backs up to, and the exchanges with it.
 *
 * One place owns the rules every surface shares (the backup dialog, the Backup section in
 * Settings, and the page that exchanges in the background):
 *
 * - two exchanges never run at once for the same folder: one asked for while another runs waits
 *   for it and then runs once, however many were asked for meanwhile;
 * - what an exchange did is handed to the page together with the folder it was for, so the page
 *   can ignore anything about a folder it has since left;
 * - when the folder last exchanged is kept in memory only — nothing new is saved for it.
 *
 * The wording lives in remoteSync.helpers.ts (pure, tested); this module is the thin reactive
 * wrapper around the IPC calls and is not imported by tests.
