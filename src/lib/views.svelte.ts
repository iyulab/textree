/*
 * Saved-views store — folder → named views, persisted to views.json (kept with the app, per vault).
 *
 * Persistence shape mirrors order.json (nav.svelte.ts): a single fixed sidecar file keyed by folder
 * path. This sidesteps enumeration (one read, filter by folder in memory), makes delete clean (drop
 * from the array — no orphan files), and uses folder paths as JSON keys (not filenames), so paths
 * like `a/b` and `a-b` never collide. New IPC 0 (reuses write_sidecar/read_sidecar).
 *
 * NOTE — deviation from the ratified `views/<slug>.json` per-view-file record: the ratified
 * load-bearing decisions (6-field schema, sidecar file, versioned JSON, file-is-truth, NEW IPC
 * 0, interop trade-off) are all preserved; only the container changes (per-view file → folder-keyed
 * map), because honoring per-view files literally would need a list/delete IPC and break "new IPC 0".
 * The ViewDefinition schema (view.helpers.ts) is untouched and stored as the map's array values.
 *
 * Pure logic (upsertView/removeView) lives in view.helpers.ts (vitest); this runes module is a thin
 * persistence wrapper and is not imported by tests, keeping pure helpers separate from reactive state.
