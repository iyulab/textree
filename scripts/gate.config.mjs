/*
 * The merge gate's steps, in the order CI runs them, plus the checks CI does not run (clippy, the
 * host test suite). `--ship` is the pre-release gate: assemble both sidecars first (the renderer at
 * the commit a release ships), then every merge step, then the E2E suite and host:smoke on the
 * assembled host. Run with `npm run gate` (see package.json); the runner is tauri-kit-dev's.
 *
 * Without --ship the sidecars must be assembled already (scripts/assemble-*-sidecar.ps1) — the Rust
 * build bundles them. The release steps stay out of the plain gate: host:smoke needs a model cache
 * and E2E needs a desktop session, which a merge gate must not depend on. With --ship they run in
 * the order that keeps each honest: the assemblies come first, so the E2E suite renders with the
 * shipped canopy and host:smoke checks a build of the current source.
