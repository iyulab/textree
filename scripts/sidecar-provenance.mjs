/**
 * Which source an assembled sidecar was built from.
 *
 * Assembled sidecars live in gitignored folders and are not rebuilt when their source changes, so
 * after a branch switch they can be builds of other code entirely — and the checks that use them
 * (`host:smoke --exe`, the E2E suite) would then verify that other build and pass. Assembling
 * records a stamp; the checks compare it with what they mean to test:
 *
 *   host    against the host source as it stands now (src-host/) and the app version it is
 *           stamped with (src-tauri/tauri.conf.json — assembling passes it to the build)
 *   canopy  against the renderer release the app ships (canopy-sidecar/) — it can also be built
 *           from a source checkout, to try a renderer change before it is released
 *
 * Stamps live under .cache/, not beside the payloads: everything under src-tauri/resources/ is
 * bundled into the installer. Each is tied to its payload by hash, so a payload replaced by hand
 * reads as unknown rather than inheriting a stamp that is not its own.
 *
 *   node scripts/sidecar-provenance.mjs stamp host               # assemble-host-sidecar.ps1 calls it
 *   node scripts/sidecar-provenance.mjs stamp canopy [checkout]  # assemble-canopy-sidecar.ps1 calls it
 *   node scripts/sidecar-provenance.mjs check <host|canopy>      # prints the verdict; exit 1 unless current/pinned
